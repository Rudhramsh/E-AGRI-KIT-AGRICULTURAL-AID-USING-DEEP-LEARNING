This project presents an agricultural aid application, developed and designed, to help farmers by utilizing Image Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts. Our application provides features such as early detection of plant disease, implemented using various approaches. After evaluation, results showed that Convolutional Neural Network was per forming better for plant disease detection with an high accuracy. It further helps the farmer to forecast the weather to decide the right time for agricultural activities like harvesting and plucking. To avoid reoccurrence of disease due to loss in soil minerals, a crop specific fertilizer calculator is incorporated which can calculate the amount of urea, diammonium phosphate and muriate of potash required for a given area. 
This project showcases an agricultural aid app that was built and designed to assist farmers by employing Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Features like early detection of plant disease are available in our application and are implemented in a number of ways. It was determined that Convolutional Neural Network was superior for detecting plant diseases with a high degree of accuracy. The farmer can use the weather forecast to plan out agricultural tasks like harvesting and plucking at the optimal time. A crop-specific fertilizer calculator is in the works to determine how much urea, diammonium phosphate, and muriate of potash should be applied to a given area to prevent the recurrence of disease caused by depleted soil minerals.


In the Deep Learning Approach, we decided to take a subset of the Plant Village dataset along with the cotton dataset to train and test the CNN model. The input image is fed into this model, which initially took a portion of the Plant Village and Cotton Dataset, with a training -validation split of 70-30, therefore getting 4200 images for training and 1800 images for validation. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning model that takes inputs which are assigned weights depending on various features. CNN is a widely used neural network for image-based datasets.
Our CNN model consists of 4 main convolutional layers with 32, 64, 128, 128 filters consecutively, each followed by a ReLU activation function, max pooling and dropout layer. This set of convolutional layers is followed by a flatten and then a dense layer which is finally followed by the softmax activation function that tells us which class has the maximum probability.
